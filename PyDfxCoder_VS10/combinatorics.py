OVERVIEW
========

This module was created to supplement Python's itertools module, filling in gaps
in two important areas of basic combinatorics:

(A) ordered and unordered m-way combinations, and
(B) generalizations of the four basic occupancy problems ('balls in boxes').

Brief descriptions of the included functions and classes follow (more detailed
descriptions and additional examples can be found in the individual doc strings
within the functions):

n_choose_m(n, m): calculate n-choose-m, using a simple algorithm that is less
likely to involve large integers than the direct evaluation of n! / m! / (n-m)!

m_way_ordered_combinations(items, ks): This function returns a generator that
produces all m-way ordered combinations (multinomial combinations) from the
specified collection of items, with with ks[i] items in the ith group, i= 0, 1,
2, ..., m-1, where m= len(ks) is the number of groups. By 'ordered
combinations', we mean that the relative order of equal- size groups is
important; the order of the items within any group is not important. The total
number of combinations generated is given by the multinomial coefficient formula
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem#Multinomial_coefficients).

m_way_unordered_combinations(items, ks): This function returns a generator that
produces all m-way unordered combinations from the specified collection of
items, with ks[i] items in the ith group, i= 0, 1, 2, ..., m-1, where m= len(ks)
is the number of groups. By 'unordered combinations', we mean that the relative
order of equal-size groups is not important. The order of the items within any
group is also unimportant.

Example of `m_way_unordered_combinations`::

   Issue the following statement from the IPython prompt:

   from combinatorics import *
   list(m_way_unordered_combinations(6,[2,2,2]))

   The output consists of the 15 combinations listed below:

   (0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)
   (0, 1), (2, 4), (3, 5)
   (0, 1), (2, 5), (3, 4)
   (0, 2), (1, 3), (4, 5)
   (0, 2), (1, 4), (3, 5)
   (0, 2), (1, 5), (3, 4)
   (0, 3), (1, 2), (4, 5)
   (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
   (0, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4)
   (0, 4), (1, 2), (3, 5)
   (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 5)
   (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3)
   (0, 5), (1, 2), (3, 4)
   (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 4)
   (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3)

unlabeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a
generator that produces all distinct distributions of indistinguishable balls
among labeled boxes with specified box sizes (capacities). This is a
generalization of the most common formulation of the problem, where each box is
sufficiently large to accommodate all of the balls, and is an important example
of a class of combinatorics problems called 'weak composition' problems.

unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a
generator that produces all distinct distributions of indistinguishable balls
among indistinguishable boxes, with specified box sizes (capacities). This is a
generalization of the most common formulation of the problem, where each box is
sufficiently large to accommodate all of the balls. It might be asked, 'In what
sense are the boxes indistinguishable if they have different capacities?' The
answer is that the box capacities must be considered when distributing the
balls, but once the balls have been distributed, the identities of the boxes no
longer matter.

Example of `unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes`::

   Issue the following commands from the IPython prompt:

   from combinatorics import *
   list(unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes(10,[5,4,3,2,1]))

   The output is as follows:

   [(5, 4, 1, 0, 0),
    (5, 3, 2, 0, 0),
    (5, 3, 1, 1, 0),
    (5, 2, 2, 1, 0),
    (5, 2, 1, 1, 1),
    (4, 4, 2, 0, 0),
    (4, 4, 1, 1, 0),
    (4, 3, 3, 0, 0),
    (4, 3, 2, 1, 0),
    (4, 3, 1, 1, 1),
    (4, 2, 2, 2, 0),
    (4, 2, 2, 1, 1),
    (3, 3, 3, 1, 0),
    (3, 3, 2, 2, 0),
    (3, 3, 2, 1, 1),
    (3, 2, 2, 2, 1)]

labeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a
generator that produces all distinct distributions of distinguishable balls
among indistinguishable boxes, with specified box sizes (capacities). This is a
generalization of the most common formulation of the problem, where each box is
sufficiently large to accommodate all of the balls.

labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes(balls, box_sizes): This function returns a
generator that produces all distinct distributions of distinguishable balls
among distinguishable boxes, with specified box sizes (capacities). This is a

Example of `labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes`::

   Issue the following statements from the IPython prompt:

   from combinatorics import *
   list(labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes(3,[2,2]))

   The output is as follows:

   [((0, 1), (2,)),
    ((0, 2), (1,)),
    ((1, 2), (0,)),
    ((0,), (1, 2)),
    ((1,), (0, 2)),
    ((2,), (0, 1))]

partitions(n): 'In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive
integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of
positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are
considered to be the same partition.'  We can trivially generate all partitions
of an integer using `unlabeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes`.  The quote is from

REVISION HISTORY
================

08-28-2012, version 1.4.1, Phillip M. Feldman:

(minor) I implemented a bug fix in `off_by_m_algorithm3`: One must copy the
result before yielding it to the calling program; otherwise, the same object is
being re-used.  This bug fix was contributed by Corran Webster of Enthought.


08-26-2012, version 1.4.0, Phillip M. Feldman:

(minor/intermediate) I added three algorithms that solve the off-by-m problem.
The first, which is the slowest, and the last, which is the fastest, were
written by me.  The second was contributed by Warren Weckesser of Enthought.


08-10-2012, version 1.3.0, Phillip M. Feldman:

(minor+) I incorporated a patch contributed by David Hollman
(david.s.hollman@gmail.com).  This patch corrects a serious flaw in the
generator function `_m_way_unordered_combinations`, which is used by
`m_way_unordered_combinations` and by `labeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes`.
Without the patch, `labelled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes` misses some valid
combinations.

(minor/intermediate) I added the function `off_by_one`, which returns a
generator that enumerates all possible solutions of the 'off-by-one' problem.


04-06-2012, version 1.2.0, Phillip M. Feldman:

I added the function `prod`, which is similar to `numpy.prod` but does all
calculations using large arithmetic when operating on a sequence of integers.

I fixed a bug in `n_choose_m`: We must force the division to be done using
integer arithmetic because otherwise Python attempts to convert the results from
`prod` into floating point numbers, which can fail for n greater than 170.

I added the function `n_choose_m_ln`.  This function calculates the natural
logarithm of choose(n,m), defined as the number of ways in which one can select
m of n distinct objects without regard for order, using SciPy's `gammaln`
function.  For large n, especially for n > 10000, this function is much faster
than `n_choose_m` (computational and memory requirements are both much lower).


10-09-2011, version 1.1.1, Phillip M. Feldman:

I added a function to generate partitions.


10-01-2011, version 1.1.0, Phillip M. Feldman:

I added input error checking to the `labeled_balls_in_unlabeled_boxes` function.

I fixed the function `m_way_ordered_combinations` so that the box order
specified via the input argument `ks` is respected.

I added the function `labeled_balls_in_labeled_boxes`.  This completes the basic
set of functions for solving occupancy functions with capacity limits.

   OVERVIEW

   This function calculates choose(n,m), defined as the number of ways in which

   1. If m > n-m, we replace m by n-m.

   2. We calculate the answer by evaluating

      prod(range(n-m+1,n+1)) / prod(range(2,m+1)),

   which is equivalent to

      n! / m! / (n-m)!


   NOTE

   Python can handle integers of arbitrary size, but the algorithm tends to bog
   down for very large values of n, partly because of the number of operations
   being performed and partly because of the memory requirements.  For values of
   n above about 10000, use `m_choose_n_ln` instead of `m_choose_n`.

   INPUTS

   `items` must be (A) a list, tuple, or other iterable, or (B) a positive
   integer.  If `items` is an integer, it is replaced by `range(items)`.

   `ks` should be either a list or tuple containing non-negative integers, where

   EXAMPLE

   Let items=[0,1,2,3,4,5] and ks=[2,2,2].  The output includes a total of 90
   combinations.  Two of these are the following:

   ((0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5))
   ((2, 3), (0, 1), (4, 5))

   increasing order before any other processing is done.
