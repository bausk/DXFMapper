#Test10.dxf: Model file to generate crown mesh
#Test10-test.dxf: Model file to test MeshPy on a diamond 3D region
#Test10-test2.dxf: Model file to test MeshPy on 'real' 3D region with polys
#Test10-ill.dxf: illustration
#Input: 3Dfaces modeling FE region boundaries, 3DPOLY's
#Output: DXF only
#Next step: Sew together three parts of the model
#Problems solved: meshing
