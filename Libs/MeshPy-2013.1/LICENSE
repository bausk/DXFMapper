Created as part of the Quake project (tools for earthquake simulation).
Supported in part by NSF Grant CMS-9318163 and an NSERC 1967 Scholarship.
There is no warranty whatsoever.  Use at your own risk.


Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay
triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and
high-quality triangular meshes.  The latter can be generated with no small
or large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.
Show Me graphically displays the contents of the geometric files used by
Triangle.  Show Me can also write images in PostScript form.

Information on the algorithms used by Triangle, including complete
references, can be found in the comments at the beginning of the triangle.c
source file.  Another listing of these references, with PostScript copies
of some of the papers, is available from the Web page
